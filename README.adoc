== Stream applications

This repository provides a collection of components that help with various data integration use cases.
It provides standalone Java functions that can be reusable in end-user applications.
Using these functions as a baseline, it already provides various out of the box Spring Cloud Stream applications that can be run standalone or to used on Spring Cloud Data Flow.
There are four major components in this repo.

* Standalone Java Functions as java.util.function.Function/Consumer/Supplier
* Core components for out of the applications
* Out of the box Spring Cloud Stream applications as Source/Sink/Processor
* An aggregator for the out of the box applications.

See the README files provided at the top of each of these components to learn more.

=== Build

You can build everything from the root of the repository.

`./mvnw clean install`

==== Building functions

`./mvnw clean install -f functions`

==== Building core for Stream Applications

`./mvnw clean install -f applications/stream-applications-core`

Most likely, you might be interested in building a subset of the available components.
Let's assume that you want to build JDBC Source app based on Kafka Binder in Spring Cloud Stream and Log Sink based on Rabbit binder.
Here is what you need to do.
Assuming that you built both functions and stream-applications-core as above.

```
./mvnw clean package -f applications/source/jdbc-source
cd applications/source/jdbc-source/apps/jdbc-source-kafka
./mvnw clean package
```

This will generate the Kafka binder based uber jar in the target folder.

Similarly for the log sink, do the following.

```
./mvnw clean package -f applications/sink/log-sink
cd applications/sink/log-sink/apps/log-sink-rabbit
./mvnw clean package
```
