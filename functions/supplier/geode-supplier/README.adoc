# Geode Supplier

This module provides a `java.util.function.Supplier` that can be reused and composed in other applications.
The `Supplier` configures an Apache Geode client that connects to an external Apache Geode cache server or locator to monitor an existing region.
The supplier uses the `CacheListeningMessageProducer` from `Spring Integration` which wraps a https://geode.apache.org/releases/latest/javadoc/org/apache/geode/cache/CacheListener.html[CacheListener]
and emits a reactive stream of objects, extracted from a Geode https://geode.apache.org/releases/latest/javadoc/org/apache/geode/cache/EntryEvent.html[EntryEvent], which holds all of the
event details.
A SpEl Expression, given by the property `geode.supplier.entry-event-expression` is used to extract desired fields information from the payload.
The default expression is `newValue` which returns the current value from the configured Region.

NOTE: Retrieving the value by itself is not always sufficient, especially if it does not contain the key value, or any additional context.
The key is referenced by the field `key`. The EntryEvent also provides the `operation` (create, update, etc).
If the cached key and value types are primitives, a simple expression like `key + ':' +newValue` may be useful.
To access the entire EntryEvent, set the expression to `#root` or `#this`.

The CacheListener emits objects to the supplier implemented as `Supplier<Flux<?>>`.
Users have to subscribe to the returned `Flux` to receive the data.

## PDX Serialization

The suppier works with PDX serialized cache objects of type https://geode.apache.org/releases/latest/javadoc/org/apache/geode/pdx/PdxInstance.html[PdxInstance], which Geode uses to store objects that can be represented as JSON. If the target region uses PDX serialization and you set  `geode.client.pdx-read-serialized` to `true`, PdxInstance objects will be returned as JSON strings.


## Beans for injection

You can import the `GeodeSupplierConfiguration` configuration in a Spring Boot application and then inject the `geodeSupplier` bean as type `Supplier<Flux<T>>`, where `T` is the expected return type.
If necessary, can use the bean name `geodeSupplier` as a qualifier.

Once injected, you can invoke the `get` method of the `Supplier` and then subscribe to the returned `Flux` to initiate the stream.

## Configuration Options

For more information on the various options available, please see:

Required properties:

* `geode.region.region-name` - The name of the existing remote region.
* `geode.pool.host-addresses` - A comma delimited list of `host:port` pairs. By default these are locator addresses but are cache server addresses if you set `geode.pool.connect-type=server`.

Additional configuration options:

* link:src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/supplier/geode/GeodeSupplierProperties.java[GeodeSupplierProperties.java] (`geode.supplier`)

Many of the options, common to functions that use Apache Geode, are configured by several `@ConfigurationProperties` classes which are included as needed:

* link:../../common/geode-common/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/common/geode/GeodeClientCacheProperties.java[GeodeClientCacheProperties.java] (`geode.client`)
* link:../../common/geode-common/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/common/geode/GeodeRegionProperties.java[GeodeRegionProperties.java] (`geode.region`)
* link:../../common/geode-common/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/common/geode/GeodePoolProperties.java[GeodePoolProperties.java] (`geode.pool`)
* link:../../common/geode-common/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/common/geode/GeodeSecurityProperties.java[GeodeSecurityProperties.java] (`geode.security`)
* link:../../common/geode-common/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/common/geode/GeodeSslProperties.java[GeodeSslProperties.java] (`geode.security.ssl`)

## Examples

See this link:src/test/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/supplier/geode/GeodeSupplierApplicationTests.java[test suite] for examples of how this supplier is used.

## Other usage

See this link:../../../applications/source/geode-source/README.adoc[README] where this supplies is used to create a Spring Cloud Stream application to emit entry events.
